Welcome to my repository where I share useful (though not flawless) codes that I've developed :)

## mask_borders
**Purpose:** Masks the borders of am image (ideal for images formed from drizzled or stacked exposures).

**Why Itâ€™s Useful:** These images often have noisy edges because the outer regions receive less exposure (often due to dithering). Masking these borders aids in source detection and reduces false identifications caused by this noise.
